      <h1 class="article-headline">About the Commission</h1>
      <div class="article-content">
      <p class="drop">On February 11, 2015, Gov. Bruce Rauner signed Executive Order 14 (2015) establishing the Illinois State Commission on Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform. Comprised of more than two dozen criminal justice practitioners, lawmakers and policymakers, the Commission is charged with developing comprehensive, evidence-based strategies to meet the goal of reducing Illinois’ prison population 25 percent by 2025.</p>

  <p>The Commission will conduct a thorough review of the state’s criminal justice and sentencing structure, sentencing practices, community supervision, and use of alternatives to incarceration. It will build upon bipartisan, data-driven, and evidence-based reforms that have reduced the use of incarceration and its costs while protecting and improving public safety. Data collection and analysis will be used to identify public safety outcomes that reduce crime, reduce recidivism, and protect the citizens of Illinois.</p>

  <p>Commission tasks include evaluation of sentencing policy, structure, and trends, and their impact on the state’s capacity for incarceration, corrections operations, and resources needed to manage offenders. Offender community reentry services and their role in reducing recidivism also will be evaluated.</p>

  <p>An initial report of the Commission’s findings and recommendations are due to the Governor by July 1, 2015. A final report is due to the Governor and the General Assembly by December 31, 2015.</p>
